    This code in the book is about encaspulation
    Encapsulation is used:
        1) Hiding Data 
        2) Simplifying Behaviour
    we encapsulate behaviour by identifying a task that needs to be done in our code and giving that task to a well-defined 
    object or function. We call the object that object or function an abstraction
